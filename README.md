## Lyrics

```

when i open the skies
when i open the skies
when i open the skies
when i open the skies
when i open the skies
when i open the skies

get it right
stuck and get it right

statement
races
got a reason for faces

look at yourself yeah
look at yourself yeah
look at yourself yeah
look at yourself yeah
look at yourself yeah
look at yourself yeah

never enough
it always been never enough

when i look in the mirror
i meet my eyes
when i look in the mirror
i eat my eyes
when i look in the  mirror
i bleed my eyes

person on the other side
side is
person on the other side is not me
what i did 
what i've seen
(what i feel)
